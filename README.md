## 6-881-website

This is a static .html webpage based off a bootstrap template!

Just `git clone` this repo, and open up `index.html` in a web browser. 

It is currently hosted from /afs/csail.mit.edu/u/r/russt/locomotion/www/data/6-881-website at manipulation.csail.mit.edu.  Log in to groups.csail.mit.edu to view the apache logs (in /var/log/apache/error.log).

If the post-commit webhook ever fails to update git, viewing http:://manipulation.csail.mit.edu/update.cgi in the browser should accomplish the same.
